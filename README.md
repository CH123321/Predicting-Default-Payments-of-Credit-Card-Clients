# Predicting-Default-Payments-of-Credit-Card-Clients
Building Lasso-Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting.
## Abstract

As an important business of the bank, credit card also brings high income and high risk to the bank. As the credit card business flourishes, banks also need to set up databases to rate customers. Based on the information provided by the credit customer, the bank can effectively evaluate the customer's credit rating to determine whether the customer will bring a default risk. According to the credit card client data of 2005 in Taiwan, this paper built Random Forest model, Lasso-Logistic model and Support Vector Machine model to explore the key factors which effect customer credit, including icredit data, sex, education, marriage, age, history of payment, and bill statements. Through comparing the AUC value of the models, we found the model of better prediction effect to forecast the bank credit card defaults. The fitted credit card default prediction model not only helps banks to choose safe clients, but also can provide certain theoretical support for the credit decisions. In addition, it has a strong theoretical and practical significance.
